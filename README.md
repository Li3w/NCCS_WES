This project implements a Snakemake-based pipeline for somatic tumor-normal paired variant calling followed by downstream annotation and analysis using a combination of powerful bioinformatics tools. It includes support for:

- Variant calling with Mutect2
- Variant filtering and artifact removal
- Copy number analysis with PureCN
- Annotation using Annovar
- Clinical relevance with OncoKB
- Tumor mutation burden with pyTMB
- Microsatellite instability (MSI) status
